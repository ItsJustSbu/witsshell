# witsshell

This Repository contains a shell project called the Witsshell which I created for my operating systems class using c <br>
you run the application by using the ./witsshell executable in Linux and you will get a bash like shell <br>
The shell uses the fork, exec, wait to be able to fulfill tasks such as ls, pwd, cd, echo and so on. <br>
It is not the complete Linux shell but it was an interesting experience having to build it<br>
